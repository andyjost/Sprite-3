# 0. Let runtime/lib be the current directory
# 1. Place/copy both Prelude.curry and Prelude.prim_c2p in the current directory
# 2. Execute: curry2cpp Prelude
#    --- For Sprite: this generates Prelude.read 
#    --- For cmd: execute the fiollowing steps
# 3. Move Prelude.cpp and Prelude.hpp from subdirectory .curry in the parent directory
# 4. Edit Prelude.cpp
#    lines in the previously generated Prelude.cpp that are commented out //hm
#    must equally be commented out in the newly compiled Prelude.cpp
# 5. Execute scons to generate the Prelude.o file
