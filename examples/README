This directory contains example code.  Many of the examples are referenced from
the main library using the Doxygen "snippet" command.  Snippets are tagged by
lines beginning with the three-character sequence "///" followed by a
square-bracket-enclosed string.

The Makefile is set up to check that these files compile without any errors or
warnings and that the resulting executables run through wihout tripping any
asserts.
