Certain tests require KiCS2 because it can narrow certain expressions that
cause PAKCS to suspend.  The test harness has not been modified to use KiCS2,
and switching from PAKCS to KiCS2 as an oracle will likely induce failures.
For now, this directory is just a place to hold these problematic tests
so they can be run manually.
